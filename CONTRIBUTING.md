# Contributing to Indian Stocks App

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Indian Stocks App as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/indian-stocks-app/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/indian-stocks-app/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Code Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `dart format` for style unification

## Development Setup

1. Install Flutter SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Set up your `.env` file
5. Run `flutter analyze` to check for issues
6. Run `flutter test` to run tests

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include both unit tests and widget tests where appropriate

## License
